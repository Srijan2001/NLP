# NLP

The overall goal for this task is to take a dataset that has some labels (entity here) and see if we can organise it in some unsupervised way (clustering is one idea). This way we can reduce the labeling effort for another task (intent detection). So, the job is to find ways to reduce the human labeling effort as low as possible.

The dataset used in the above task is:
1)MIT Movie Corpus
2)MIT Restaurant Corpus

The dataset has been analysed and statistics such as distribution of each tags, number of samples and so on have been calculated.

After this, the data has been clustered in different clusters that have similar intents using 2 ways:
1) K-Means clustering
2) Sentence Transformers based clustering
